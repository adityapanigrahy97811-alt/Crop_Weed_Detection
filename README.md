# Crop_Weed_Detection
his project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect and classify weeds in crop field images. The model processes agricultural images, identifies weed presence, and helps improve farming efficiency by enabling targeted weed control. It reduces manual effort, increases yield, and supports precision agriculture using AI.
